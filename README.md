#### TABLEAU
IMDb Movies Dataset

IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content. 

It was founded in 1990 and acquired by Amazon in 1998. IMDb is considered to be one of the most comprehensive sources of information on movies and TV shows, featuring cast and crew lists, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, reviews, and more. It is widely used by movie and TV enthusiasts, professionals in the entertainment industry, and researchers.

The data for this Analysis was obtained from Kaggle whose link can be found in the IMDB.pptx above. 

The dashboard was segmented into two parts: the Users' aspect and the Producers' aspect

The Users can interact with the dashboard through the slicers to select the year, genre, and title of the movie they wanted, and in return the dashboard will display the rating of the movie, runtime (duration of the movie), the stars in the movie, and Location where the Movie was filmed. 

The Producer aspect is Static and produces information about the most seen genre, the money made per certification, and others.
